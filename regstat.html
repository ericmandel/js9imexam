<h3>Region Statistics </h3>

A rectangular box of image pixels is selected and some statical values 
are computed from the data.  The selected box may be rotated for box and 
ellipse regions.

<p>
<b>N.B.:</b> Currently the region shape is ignored and the values reflect a rectangular section of image pixels.

<blockquote>
    <h4>Notes</h4>

    <ul>
     <li><b>Background and Noise</b>
     <p>
	    The background and noise are obtained from the outer 4 pixel-wide
	    perimeter of the selected region.  The background value is the median 
	    value of this area and the noise value is the RMS.
     </li>
     <li><b>Centroid</b>
     <p>
	    The centroid is obtained by locating the brightest 9 pixel box and 
	    computing the centroid of the background subtracted data about this point.
     </li>
     <li><b>FWHM</b>
     <p>
	    The FWHM is estimated from the image moments about the centroid, assuming 
	    a Gaussian distribution.
     </li>
