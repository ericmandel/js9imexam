<h3>Encircled Energy</h3>

A rectangular box of image pixels is sectected and background subtracted.  The 
analysis radius is determined from the region as follows:

    <ul>
     <li><b>circle</b>: region radius</li>
     <li><b>annulus</b>: max annulus radius</li>
     <li><b>box</b>: half the average height an width</li>
     <li><b>ellipse</b>: verage axis radius</li>
     <li><b>polygon</b>: half the average of the height and width of polygon bounding box</li>
    </ul>

The values within the analysis radius are binned in 1 pixel radial bins.  The
bins are normalized by the sum of all pixels and the result is plotted.

<p>
The background is obtained as the median from the outer 4 pixel wide perimeter of the
selected region.

<p>
The center pixel from which the encircled energy is computed is determined from
the background subtracted centroid taken about the brightest 9 pixels in the
data (same centroid as is displayed in the region stats plugin).

<p>
The 50 and 80 percent encircled energy points are displayed over the plot.
