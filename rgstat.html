<h3>Region Statistics </h3>

A rectangular box of image pixels is sectected and some statical values 
are computed from the data.  The selected box may be rotated for box and 
ellipse regions.

<blockquote>
    <h4>Notes</h4>

    <ul>
     <li><b>Background and Noise</b>
     <p>
	    The background and noise are obtained from the outer 4 pixel wide
	    perimeter of the selected region.  The background value is the median 
	    value of this area and the noise value is the RMS.
     </li>
     <li><b>Centroid</b>
     <p>
	    The centroid is obtained by locating the brightest 9 pixel box and 
	    computing the centroid of the background subtracted data about this point.
     </li>
     <li><b>FWHM</b>
     <p>
	    The FWHM is estimated from the image moments about the centroid assuming 
	    a gausian distribution.
     </li>
