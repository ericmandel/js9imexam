<h3>Region Statistics </h3>

A rectangualr box of image pixels is sectected and some statical values 
are computed from the data.  The selected box may be rotated for box and 
ellipse regions.

<h3>Notes</h3>

<ul>
 <li><b>Background and Noise</b>
 <p>
	The background and noise are obtained by from the outer 4 pixel wide
	perimeter the selected region.  The background value is the median of 
	the area and the noise value is the RMS.
 </li>
 <li><b>Centroid</b>
 <p>
	The centroid is obtained by locating the brightest 9 pixel box and 
	computing the centroid of the background subtracted data about this point.
 </li>
 <li><b>FWHM</b>
 <p>
	The FWHM is estimated from the image moments about the centroid assuming 
	a gausian distribution.
