<h3>Radial Profile</h3>

A rectangular box of image pixels is selected and the pixels values are
plotted against their respective radii.  A Gaussian is fit to the radial profile
data and the result is also plotted.  The fitted results of the 4 parameter fit
are displayed with the plot.  The selected box may be rotated for box and 
ellipse regions.

<p>
The center pixel from which the radii are computed is determined from the
background subtracted centroid taken about the brightest 9 pixels in the data
(same centroid as is displayed in the region stats plugin).
